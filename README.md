# SprintReviewAndRetrospective
A document containing a review and retrospective of the Scrum-agile process explored at SNHU

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I can interpret user needs by communicating with users to find out what it is they want out of the program and then creating user stories that clearly lay out what those wants would look like in the real world. Once we have clear expectations of what the user wants and what it should look like, we can begin writing the code necessary to bring the user stories to life. User stories are helpful in compartmentalizing user wants into clear tasks that need to be carried out to deliver value.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I can approach developing programs by utilizing the Scrum-agile approach and implementing iterations into my development process. Iterations are helpful in a number of ways including creating a minimum viable product and building momentum towards completing the project. Agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work include creating user stories, breaking stories down into story points, determining what I can accomplish in any given sprint, and sprint retrospectives where I attempt to use lessons learned to improve future sprints.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member involves a lot of behaviors. Some of those behaviors include being honest, cooperative, being able to listen and communicate effectively, being open to constructive criticism, delivering value, and keeping up with deadlines.
